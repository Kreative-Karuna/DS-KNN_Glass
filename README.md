# DS-KNN_Glass

## Problem Statement :
  A glass manufacturing plant uses different earth elements to design new glass materials based on customer requirements. 
  For that, they would like to automate the process of classification as itâ€™s a tedious job to manually classify them. 
  Help the company achieve its objective by correctly classifying the glass type based on the other features using KNN algorithm.
## Business Objective : 
  To classify the Glass type based on various material used in manufacturing the glass.
## Constraints : 
  Correctness of the amounts in the contents is necessary to avoid misclassification of the type of glass.
